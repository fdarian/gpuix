/// React Fast Refresh over the GPUIX reconciler.
///
/// This is the regression guard for browser HMR. `bun scripts/web.ts` gets its
/// hot updates from `react-refresh`, which never talks to a renderer directly:
/// it patches the React DevTools global hook, keeps the `scheduleRefresh` and
/// `setRefreshHandler` helpers that `reconciler.injectIntoDevTools()` passes in,
/// and drives updates through them.
///
/// If that injection ever stops working there is no error and no page reload.
/// Bun still accepts the update and still calls `performReactRefresh()`, which
/// finds zero mounted roots and schedules nothing, so the painted UI silently
/// stays stale. Only a test can catch that.
///
/// `injectIntoGlobalHook` has to run before `reconciler.ts` evaluates, so
/// `@ghia/react` is loaded with a dynamic import after the hook is installed.
/// A static import would evaluate first and the injection would find no hook.
