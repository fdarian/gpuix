/**
 * Build the browser Wasm target and serve the example with HMR.
 *
 * Bun's frontend dev server bundles `examples/web.html`, watches its module
 * graph, and runs the React Fast Refresh transform. An edit to
 * `examples/chat.tsx` keeps `useState`, so the GPUI canvas, the wasm module,
 * and the scroll position all survive the update.
 *
 * The wasm half must never re-evaluate. `WebGpuixRenderer::init` fails with
 * "GPUIX web is already running" once `WEB_APP` is set, and `gpui_web` appends
 * its own canvas to `<body>`. What protects it is not that it lives in
 * `node_modules` — Bun bundles it into the same client registry as the app.
 * It is that Bun re-runs only the changed module and then walks *upward*
 * through its importers, so an unchanged dependency stays evaluated and cached.
 * Keep Wasm init in a module that can never become an HMR boundary and is never
 * explicitly accepted. Only a full page reload re-creates it, which is fine.
 *
 * `/` serves the chat example and `/infinite` serves the infinite history one.
 *
 *   bun scripts/web.ts               # build the Wasm if it is missing, then serve
 *   bun scripts/web.ts --rebuild     # force the cargo + wasm-bindgen step first
 *   bun scripts/web.ts --build-only  # only cargo + wasm-bindgen, do not serve
